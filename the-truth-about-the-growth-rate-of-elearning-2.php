				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Does your child need help with math or biology?  Do you want to learn more about starting a home business?  In the past you would have contacted your local learning center to help your child with their studies.  Then you would have stopped by the local book store or library to find books on starting a home business.  While these methods are useful, they are beginning to become a thing of the past.  Elearning has begun to overshadow traditional learning methods.  <br><br>What is elearning?  Elearning refers to any education that you receive electronically whether it is through the Internet or from a software program.  Elearning is sweeping the nation because it has become affordable and is easy to access from the comfort of your own home.  Plus, you can work on your own schedule.  You don’t have to worry about hiring a babysitter while you head off to class.  The class comes to you through your computer when you have an hour or even minutes to spare during your hectic day.<br><br>Elearning began through various software programs available for your computer.  You just popped in a disk or CD-rom into your computer and you were set to go.  You could practice your typing skills at home and your children could practice their math skills through computer drills and games.  This type of learning provided extra practice for your child.  The software programs increased in number, but you were still limited to interacting only with the disk or CD-rom.  You didn’t have access to the software program’s creator or additional resources to peruse through at your leisure.<br><br>Internet based elearning programs stepped in to fill these needs.  Elearning on the Internet allowed users to break the confines of their personal computer and interact with the global community.  The options to connect with the course creator/teacher, fellow students, and have live class discussions were now available.  Additional resources for exploration and study are endless with the use of the Internet as an educational tool.  Therefore, the growth rate of elearning has skyrocketed since the Internet has become a daily resource for many users.<br><br>Elearning contains so many different levels of interest.  More in depth courses are provided at a cost, while free courses are also available.  Users should take advantage of the elearning opportunities available on the Internet.  You can start by typing your topic of interest in an Internet search engine.  You will most likely find a course that suits your needs.
