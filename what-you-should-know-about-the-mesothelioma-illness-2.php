				<span style="font-size: 11pt">What is Mesothelioma? A lot of people are not aware of <br>this disease and thus, die due to the delay in <br>diagnosis. Millions of people die every year because of <br>cancer; it is among the most pervasive illnesses every <br>one of us is exposed to. Generally speaking, a cancer <br>is a group of diseases characterized by alarming rapid <br>growth of abnormal cells in the body. The disease can <br>affect almost any part of the body and among the most <br>commonly affected are the lungs. Cancer-causing <br>substances are everywhere, especially in the air that <br>we breathe so the lungs are vulnerable to several fatal <br>diseases. One rare cancer that affects the lungs is <br>Mesothelioma. <br><br>Mesothelioma has been popularized only because of its <br>association with asbestos, a fibrous mineral form of <br>magnesium silicate used in fireproofing, chemical <br>filters, electrical insulation and others. Most of the <br>patients diagnosed with Mesothelioma have been <br>frequently exposed to asbestos. They are those who work <br>in construction sites, shipyards, insulator makers and <br>similar places. They usually inhale the impure fibers <br>from the asbestos that float through the air.<br><br>It can be noted that there are about 30-50 per cent of <br>Mesothelioma patients who did not have any exposure to <br>asbestos, which leads to the assumption that asbestos <br>may not be the sole cause of Mesothelioma. There are <br>some Mesothelioma patients, too, that had only little <br>exposure to asbestos but had contracted the disease. <br>Activities such as washing clothes of a person who has <br>been exposed to asbestos can still put a person at high <br>risk of Mesothelioma cancer. This disease takes years <br>to develop so a person exposed to asbestos might be <br>diagnosed with Mesothelioma only after 20-50 years of <br>the exposure.<br><br>Like other forms of cancers, Mesothelioma is named <br>after the part which is affected by the disease. In the <br>case of Mesothelioma, the malignant cells are found in <br>the mesothelium, a protective sac that covers different <br>internal organs. This protective sac produces fluid <br>that lubricates the organs, allowing them to move. They <br>allow the beating of the heart and expanding and <br>contracting of the lungs, for example. Specifically, <br>Mesothelioma affects the lining of the lung and chest <br>cavity. There are some cases, too, that the lining of <br>the abdomen (peritoneum) is the one affected. These two <br>types of Mesothelioma cancer are known as Pleural <br>Mesothelioma (affecting the lungs) and Peritoneal <br>Mesothelioma (affecting the abdomen). <br><br>Symptoms of Pleural Mesothelioma include panting, <br>persistence of cough, loss of weight, fever and chest <br>pain. On the other hand, Peritoneal Mesothelioma may <br>cause swelling and pain of the abdomen and also weight <br>loss. During the early stages of Mesothelioma, the <br>symptoms are non-specific; thus, the disease is not <br>immediately identified. Also, the symptoms are often <br>mistaken as signs of pneumonia. There are instances too <br>that the patient doesn’t show any sign of this deadly <br>cancer. <br><br>If a patient manifests any of the said symptoms, he <br>must immediately seek a physician’s help. Usually, an <br>xray is required to clearly see the abnormalities in <br>the lungs (in the case of Pleural Mesothelioma). <br>Indications of a Mesothelioma cancer include a build-up <br>of fluid between the pleura covering of the chest wall <br>and the diaphragm. In normal conditions, the <br>mesothelial cells produce only small amount of fluid <br>enough to lubricate the space between the chest wall <br>and the lung. <br><br>The chance of a patient’s recovery from Mesothelioma <br>depends on the extent or stage of the disease and <br>location of the disease. Furthermore, the person’s age <br>and the way he responds to treatment and medication can <br>tell whether he can survive the cancer or not. <br>Generally the patient’s option for treatment include: <br>surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and anticancer <br>drugs.<br>
