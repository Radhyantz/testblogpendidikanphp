				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Here's the situation.  You are at home trying to answer questions for a history assignment and you are stumped.  You have to write about "Custard's last stand".  Custard was something you ate for dessert as far as you were concerned.  You check through your history book, but there was only one short paragraph about Lt. Colonel Custard.  What are you going to do?  Hop on the Internet for homework help of course!<br><br>The Internet is the information superhighway and is not just a place for e-mail, instant messages, and games.  There are numerous websites that provide homework help.  Homework websites range from just providing information like an Encyclopedia to having your questions answered by a live tutor.  Let's take a look at some of the different homework websites available.<br><br>INFO PLEASE - THE HOMEWORK CENTER:  http://www.infoplease.com/homework/<br>This website presents reference information from Almanacs, Atlases, Encyclopedias, and Biographies.  You can type in a word such as "cotton gin" and the website will search for any information regarding the cotton gin in their reference resources.  For example, the dictionary will provide a definition of the cotton gin while the Atlas and Encyclopedias will show you where and how the cotton gin was used.  You can skip searching through the reference stacks at the library because the information will be found in a matter of seconds.<br><br>You can also find great information on all your school subjects.  For example, you can read about the history of math and learn scientific terms.  <br><br>HOMEWORK HELP:  http://www.homeworkhelp.com/<br>This website provides educational services including:  software, information, and tutors.  They have step-by-step lessons on various academic subjects.  The lessons are in an easy to read and understand format.  For example, math lessons have colorful illustrations and explain each step of a problem thoroughly.  A great advantage is that you can work through the subjects at your own pace.  You can ask well qualified tutors questions.  <br><br>Homework help on the web can save you when you don't understand a topic and the assignment is due the next day.  The constant availability of homework help is wonderful, but use homework help as an additional resource so you can learn more about a topic then is expected.  You will find that some subjects spark your interest more than others.  Determine the topics that you are interested in and find as much information as you can.  <br><br>At the same time, you will find topics that seem difficult and you might be embarrassed to ask about them in front of your class.  Using homework help on the web could help you to understand the topic in the embarrassment-free zone of your own home.  Logon to the Internet - Lt. Colonel Custard is waiting for you.
