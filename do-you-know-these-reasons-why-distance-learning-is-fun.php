				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Distance learning and elearning are usually linked with<br>furthering an education. The technology of distance<br>learning, along with the opportunities provided by<br>elearning and online courses, are making it easier for<br>thousands of people to learn something new. <br><br>Busy adults can advance their careers by finishing a degree<br>or gaining some special skills, and young students can earn<br>college credit well before they graduate high school, often<br>through distance learning or elearning opportunities.<br><br>But do you realize that distance learning and elearning can<br>be just for fun? Maybe it's always been a dream - to learn<br>to paint with watercolors. But there's no class offered<br>nearby. Or maybe you've had a desire to learn to master a<br>foreign language, not because of any requirements to do so,<br>but simply because you want to know how. <br><br>Perhaps it's even more basic than that - your lawnmower<br>continually breaks down and you just want to be able to<br>impress your friends by fixing it yourself. <br><br>Technology often advances in response to specific needs.<br>People needed a way to finish a degree online so<br>businesses, universities and colleges stepped in to create<br>that opportunity. <br><br>But as is often the case, the technology exists in a basic<br>format and users have some control over what happens next.<br>That's probably the reason that some very basic skills,<br>trades and lessons can be learned online - "elearned." <br><br>The idea of lifelong learning is not new, though some of<br>the terms generally associated with lifelong learning are<br>constantly being updated. Distance learning, elearning and<br>other such words signify the ability for a person to gain<br>knowledge without sitting in a classroom. <br><br>Most adults continue to long for knowledge long after their<br>days in a classroom are over. Different people set about<br>gaining that knowledge in different ways. Some choose<br>topics and just start reading, gathering whatever books and<br>materials they can find. <br><br>Others seek out the professionals and sign up for lessons<br>or classes. Many people are putting technology to work for<br>them, seeking out online courses for elearning about a<br>myriad of topics.<br><br>It's easy to find colleges, universities and businesses<br>that offer degrees or specific classes as either distance<br>learning or online courses. Finding those "fun" things<br>might be a little more difficult, but you can start by<br>talking to family and friends. <br><br>You might find that some of them have even taken some<br>online courses. Check with local schools, colleges,<br>universities, community centers and libraries. While these<br>aren't clearing houses of information about online classes,<br>there may be listings of specific classes available. <br>===========================================================<br>Find out why distance learning lets anyone go back to<br>school.
