				<span style="font-size: 11pt">More and more people are finding that knowledge really is power, and that they can accomplish their education goals online.  Best of all, these online learners are finding that degrees from accredited colleges and universities are increasing their earnings potential, giving them greater responsibility in their professions, and best of all – giving them the chance to accomplish a key goal without completely interrupting their existing lives.
<br>
<br>There are many reasons to consider distance-learning programs for your goals.  Instructors who have taught distance learning courses originating in the United States to Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and Europe, report these as the top reasons distance learning makes sense:
<br>
<br><b>Make a strong future from investing time today</b> - Many of distance learning students are on assignment in foreign countries, and while working full-time on their jobs, they use their evenings and spare time to earn bachelors and masters’ degrees that have a direct impact on their future job opportunities and professional advancement.
<br>
<br><b>Certify your knowledge </b> - Many distance learning students have years of experience in their professions, and just lack of college degree that proves their knowledge.  Distance learning gives these working professionals a chance to share their in-depth knowledge while at the same time earning degrees that illustrate their expertise.
<br>
<br><b>Get to your educational goals on your timetable</b> - While distance learning programs have scheduled classes online and you interact with instructors, you can move as quickly as you want through many courses.  Likewise, many instructors will work with you if something comes up in your life that takes time away from school.
<br>
<br><b>Pick up more marketable skills</b> - The depth of distance learning courses has become impressive in recent years, thanks to the Internet’s performance increasing in many parts of the world – and most importantly – schools offering courses that deliver skills immediately marketable.  
<br>
<br><b>Start a new career - </b>Distance learning is great for anyone looking to get into an entirely new field – one that they have been looking at for years, or one that has sparked their interest lately – in either case distance learning gives anyone the flexibility to take their careers in entirely new directions without stopping their lives in the process.
<br>
<br><b>Connect one-on-one with instructors</b>  - Learning on-line gives students the opportunity to interact with their instructors to a greater depth than is typically possible in larger, more traditional classroom settings.  
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Bottom Line:</b> Distance Learning is growing by 33% a year worldwide according to market estimates from International Data Corporation and the U.S. Department of Education.  Universities worldwide are working to tailor their programs for this exciting new approach to learning.  Chances are there are programs available today that will get you to your educational goals.
