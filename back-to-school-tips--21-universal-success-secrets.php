				<span style="font-size: 11pt">For children and adults of all ages, it's back to school time once again. In fact, until 2013, total enrollment for degree-granting institutions alone is projected to increase an estimated average of 19 percent to 18.2 million students.<br><br>However, regardless of age and level of education, back to school time generally signals time to meet new teachers and new friends. Time to learn new subjects and try new things.<br><br>What could come in handy is a set of basic guidelines or Guide to Success for students. Universal laws from those who've been there, done that.<br><br>With that in mind, Keynote Speaker Gregory Scott Reid, AKA The Millionaire Mentor, began listing some common denominators in order to share them with others and help them succeed.<br><br>"I've been very fortunate to have had some success in my life, as well as the opportunity to meet with some very powerful and influential people over the years," said Gregory Scott Reid, three-time number one best-selling author of, "The Millionaire Mentor," "Wake Up: Live The Life You Love," and "Positive Impact." "These are the common laws that each seemed to follow, and I now wish to share them with you."<br><br>Universal Success Secrets:<br><br>1. Always maintain a positive, solution-seeking attitude.<br><br>2. To truly succeed at anything, your chances increase when you enjoy the task. When you do what you love and love what you do, you'll have success your whole life through.<br><br>3. The only limitations you really have are those you give yourself.<br><br>4. The only expectations you need to fulfill are those you give yourself.<br><br>5. Nothing is as powerful as a positive attitude, and nothing is as detrimental as a negative one.<br><br>6. Morally speaking, if you have to wonder whether something is right or wrong, chances are it's wrong.<br><br>7. When you focus on other people's success, yours is sure to follow.<br><br>8. Live your word. Lead  by example.<br><br>9. Share. (Wealth + Information + Glory = Success)<br><br>10. You have the best chance of reaching a goal by simply giving yourself one to reach.<br><br>11. Observe every obstacle as a learning experience. The greater the challenge, the greater the reward.<br><br>12. Do the hardest thing first, and the rest will be easy.<br><br>13. Treat others the way that they  want to be treated.<br><br>14. Few great accomplishments have ever been achieved by anyone alone; seek support from those whose talents exceed your own.<br><br>15. You are the reflection of the five people you associate with most, and your income is the average of those five people. Choose your friends wisely.<br><br>16. A dream written down with a date becomes a GOAL. A goal broken down into steps becomes a PLAN. A plan backed by ACTION makes your dream come true.<br><br>17. You can learn more about someone's character on one bad day than on all their good days put together. The true measure of all great leaders is how well they weather storms.<br><br>18. It's better to invest time doing what pleases you, rather than to waste time trying to please everyone else.<br><br>19. In the end, the extent of your own success will be measured by the accomplishments that you have helped create in others.<br><br>20. Having potential simply means that you possess talents and abilities you aren't applying.<br><br>21. Things are the way you think they are, because you think they are that way. Your perception determines your experience.<br><br>"It's All Who You Know"<br><br>Reid invites people from all walks of life to, "It's All Who You Know," an Inspirational Awards weekend & Charitable Event.
