				<span style="font-size: 11pt">When the words "distance learning" are used, it's often<br>with the idea of achieving a degree or attaining a specific<br>certificate. But what if your company needs specialized<br>learning opportunities? <br><br>Or what if you are a small company and simply don't have<br>the means to hire a teacher to help your employees gain a<br>specific skill? The answer could very well be an elearning<br>class from one of the companies that offer special course<br>work.<br><br>Managers around the country need some basic skills that are<br>the same from one business to the next. If a manager has a<br>degree, he usually has at least the basis for managing a<br>business. But what happens when the needs of the company<br>change? Or when it's time to get updated training for the<br>manager? <br><br>A few decades ago, a manager would simply have continued to<br>use the skills he already had without ever really getting<br>any new training. The company's dilemma is evident - the<br>manager can't be spared from his current duties to attend<br>classes for updated training, and the company is less<br>likely to prosper if the manager continues to use outdated<br>management practices. Elearning is an answer for that<br>problem. <br><br>Specialized coursework is especially efficient for<br>companies with personnel scattered across the country (or<br>even around the world). Consider the company that has<br>offices in several countries. The managers all need some<br>updated training and getting a special course put together<br>means they'll all be operating on the same page. <br><br>The course can be offered either as distance learning with<br>all employees who will attend "meeting" online at a preset<br>time, or as elearning with employees being required to<br>finish an online course in a set period of time. <br><br>What could be better than a united business with consistent<br>business practices? Accountants, bookkeepers, secretaries,<br>security people or any other group could be brought up to<br>date on government requirements and company policies.<br><br>Perhaps your company is undergoing growing pains and it's<br>time to help your employee base increase basic knowledge.<br>Offering distance learning or elearning opportunities in<br>specific areas can accomplish this while benefiting both<br>the employee and the company. <br><br>For some companies, providing their own elearning sites<br>could be a great benefit for business. Imagine the selling<br>power it would add to tout an online training course in the<br>use of a particular product or service. With the technology<br>available, it's possible to create custom distance learning<br>or elearning courses, often with personnel already on<br>staff. <br>===========================================================<br>Find out why distance learning lets anyone go back to<br>school.
