				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Just a few decades ago, distance learning existed only in<br>the imaginations of science fiction writers. Of course,<br>computers were as big as a house and only those same<br>science fiction writers wove stories of a world in which<br>computers were commonplace. <br><br>While technology has not taken the strides some predicted<br>and we Earthlings didn't colonize the moon by the year<br>2000, there are many who probably never expected that most<br>people log onto the Internet on a regular basis.<br><br>The great advances in technology have created a couple of<br>new situations. As with any new gadget, there has to be<br>someone who can work on it. When cars first hit the scene,<br>those who could understand the workings of a gas engine<br>were in great demand. <br><br>Even more demanding was the need for training to stay<br>abreast of the development of the automobile. The same is<br>true today of the computer technology. <br><br>But the techs of today have a great advantage that wasn't<br>available when auto mechanics were trying to learn. They<br>have computers and access to instant communication through<br>computer networks. <br><br>That means that the very subject they need to learn more<br>about is instrumental in keeping them up-to-date in their<br>field. Like those who are already busy with adult<br>responsibilities, computer techs have limited time for<br>training, classes and certifications. <br><br>But they have a definite need for those things, many on a<br>continuous basis. Distance learning and elearning can be<br>the answer. <br><br>While it's always been possible to learn without being in a<br>classroom, the opportunities to do so were limited by a<br>number of factors. One of the biggest problems with<br>learning outside the classroom has always been the fact<br>that students didn't have an opportunity to actively<br>participate. <br><br>If a student simply reads text and takes a test to discover<br>whether he retained the knowledge, he's likely to get<br>something from the course. A student who is allowed to talk<br>to others, ask questions and observe the questions of other<br>students is much more likely to gain the knowledge. <br><br>Even elearning (typically in the form of online courses)<br>offers the opportunity to do interactive activities and<br>students usually get feedback along the way to help them<br>stay on track. <br><br>Distance learning and elearning are no longer fictional<br>ideas, but have become a reality that is opening doors to<br>many who would otherwise have missed an opportunity. And by<br>offering technical training to those who work closely with<br>computers, the distance learning and elearning options will<br>likely continue to grow.<br>===========================================================<br>Find out why distance learning lets anyone go back to<br>school.

 About the author:<br>
 
  John Tipton dropped out of school early, and worked boring <br>jobs for 20 years. Then he discovered 'distance learning' <br>and finally got the education he missed. After lots of <br>different courses at lots of different schools, Peter <br>shares his experience in this series of useful articles. <br></font>
