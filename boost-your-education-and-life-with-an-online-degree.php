				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Obtaining an online bachelors degree can be a swift and easy way to further your career,prospects and life in general. But before you enroll, there are a few important points you need to know get your head around. <br><br>Number one, you'll want to make ensure that the college that offers you a degree online is accredited. School and universities are accredited on a national or state level. This accreditation means that a relevant board of education has researched and approved the schools curriculum and course. <br><br>Secondly, you will want to make sure that the school is highly recognized and that the bachelors degree can be transfered. This will help because someday you might need to further enhance your education by completing your masters degree and you might be required to transfer your bachelors credits. <br><br>Prerequisite to obtaining your bachelors degree from a university or college, First you must have the minimum of a G.E.D or a high school diploma. It will also help to have some college or previous work experience under your belt. If you have attained previous college credits, then they can be put toward your bachelors degree program and the period of time that you will need to be enrolled in school will be shortened. <br><br>If you have not attained previous college credits, The majority of bachelors degree online programs take about thirty six months to finish. This period of time is based on a person that takes a minimum of twenty hours of course work per week. With previous college credits, or by spending a larger amount of time on course work every week, some individuals can finish their bachelors online degree program in as little as twelve months. <br><br>To choose which university or college to enroll with, it is best to decide what type of degree program you require. The majority of colleges offer these type of programs but some specialize in man varied fields. For example, an individual who wants a bachelors degree in business might decide to go with Ashworth College, while a person that wants an degree for education would want to go with Penn State University. <br><br>When you have chosen a bachelors online degree course, you need to research its class schedule. Most online programs or courses allow you to download the course work and complete it at your own leisure, but some programs insist that you log on to the Internet for virtual class sessions at a designated time a few times a week. Now you know the basics you will see that making up for lost time can be easier than you might have thought and topping up your education is a real possibility. Go on what have you got to lose?
