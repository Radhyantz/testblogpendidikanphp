				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Before distance learning and elearning, students in rural<br>school districts were often at a great disadvantage when it<br>came to subjects being offered. A small school district<br>sometimes didn't have the resources to attract teachers<br>that were in high demand. <br><br>Math, science and foreign language classes were often<br>limited because of this shortage. Today, distance learning<br>and elearning have changed the way school districts<br>determine class schedules, making many more opportunities<br>available to students. <br><br>Public schools have changed dramatically over the past<br>century and a great number of those changes can be put down<br>to two factors - state and federal mandates governing the<br>classes that must be offered and requirements for<br>graduation, and (of course) the ever-increasing world of<br>technology. <br><br>Computers have made the world a global neighborhood in<br>which anyone can instantly communicate with those from<br>another country, even if that country is half way around<br>the world. Language and time differences are virtually the<br>only barriers. This means that distance learning and<br>elearning are a part of the curriculum of many schools.<br><br>As schools began to connect to the Internet, the immediate<br>concern in most cases was how to regulate the use. The next<br>was how to best use the technology to benefit school<br>districts and students. Distance learning and elearning<br>became the way to provide options, especially in those<br>rural districts that couldn't meet state mandates.<br><br>Consider the situation of many smaller, rural schools. If<br>the school is required to offer a foreign language but<br>can't recruit a teacher, what should happen to that school?<br>Forced consolidations have been common in some states.<br>Students lost the benefits of schools in their own towns<br>and faced long bus rides to new districts. <br><br>With distance learning and elearning, more schools can meet<br>the state and federal mandates to offer specific classes.<br><br>Consider yet another situation. A smaller district has four<br>students who show great promise in their math studies and<br>it's quickly apparent that they could go well beyond the<br>normal math classes offered in high school. <br><br>There's no one on the teaching staff capable of teaching<br>those advanced concepts and it's financially impossible to<br>hire someone for that task alone. Distance learning or e-<br>earning could provide those classes. <br><br>Special needs children are another group to greatly benefit<br>from distance learning and elearning. While many issues can<br>only be dealt with between teacher and student, face-to-<br>face, there are many things that can be taught and learned<br>online. <br><br>Whether the subject of distance learning or elearning is a<br>foreign language or sign language, and whether the class or<br>courses are being offered to one student or the entire<br>student body, distance learning and elearning have become<br>an important tool for many public schools.<br>===========================================================<br>Find out why distance learning lets anyone go back to<br>school.

 About the author:<br>
 
  John Tipton dropped out of school early, and worked boring <br>jobs for 20 years. Then he discovered 'distance learning' <br>and finally got the education he missed. After lots of <br>different courses at lots of different schools, Peter <br>shares his experience in this series of useful articles. <br></font>
