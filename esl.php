				<span style="font-size: 11pt">How To Find The Best Foreign Language Courses? <br><br><br>You have precisely made up your mind to master foreign language and to bring the knowledge of this language to perfection? For sure you want to prove yourself that you can cope with mastering a foreign language. Good command of this language became the point of honor for you or you just want to understand what the beset people are talking about. You may need the knowledge of this language for studying, work or business. In a word, you want to grapple this troublesome point last and all the time. No problems, all these goals are achievable; the main point is to have a strong motivation and to be consistent with what exactly you want to attain, to have an eager desire to cognate the language and to find a place where all your plans will see their realization.<br><br>This place is highly qualified language courses with One-to-One teaching by experienced teacher in a relaxed home atmosphere and perfect acquisition of this language is in the bag. Nothing of the sort. Preliminary, you have to confront with the choice of language courses. It is a well-known fact that a variety of foreign language courses is rather broad and bewildering. There are estimated to be more than 1000 language courses in the UK. It will be rather difficult to enumerate the quantity of such organizations in the USA. It can absolutely distract you. As they sprang up like mushrooms and it is very easy to go astray in their diversity, even for the most versed teacher. <br><br><br><br> NB! All of these criteria are based on the personal experience, tested in practice and provided with the pin - point comments.<br><br>Pay special attention to these points when you choose the courses to attend.<br><br>•	The facilities the courses have: libraries, study room, computers and special learning language facilities.<br>Remember that technical support of studying is very important as it can make the process of language acquisition less laborious, but more enjoyable and can enhance the results of your studying and speed up the process of mastering the language.  <br> <br><br>•	The location of the courses. <br>It is clear that you are ready to overcome any obstacles on your way to language acquisition, but you can not but agree with me that it would be more suitable if the courses were located somewhere not too far a way from your house or dormitory.<br> <br>•	The size of the class.<br>A class size of up to 10 students is small; 10-15 is average and over the class which includes 15 students is large. Keep in mind one very significant point when choosing the courses. The smaller the group is the better it is. It can be explained very easily if there are few people in the class a teacher can approach to each student individually.<br><br>•	The levels of abilities the classes are divided into and the way they are determined.<br>It is important for you to be in the class with the students who have approximately the same level of abilities as you do, because the appropriate course of studying is sorted out according to the level of language acquisition you acquire. Be sure to write a test which will determine the level of your language acquisition and your abilities. <br><br>•	The quantity of hours of classes per week.<br>At least 15 hours per week are required for a student visa. It is also significant for a kind of program you’ll choose. For instance, if you choose the intensive course so the quantity of hours of classes per week increases twice from the quantity of hours required for the standard course.<br><br>•	The time of the day the classes are held.<br>The prices for morning, afternoon and evening classes usually vary. So if time permits make use of the opportunity to pay less for the courses and to choose the morning or afternoon groups, as the fee for these classes is always lower. <br><br>•	The nationality and age of your classmates.<br>Remember that if the proportion of the foreign students is more than a half, it is more evidently that studying in such class will present some difficulties for you; hence it’ll be better to refuse from such a proposal. The age is also important, because people of different ages perceive information in different ways, quicker or slower, so the types of exercises and the speed of studying will be different.  <br><br>•	   The qualification and experience of the teacher.<br>It is not a secret for anyone that approximately 30 percents of academic success depends on the teacher, so redouble your vigilance at the very first test lesson in the courses and make sure that the manner of teaching and personality of the teacher suit you. If you have any hesitations change to study under different teacher without any doubts.  <br><br>•	The nationality of the teacher.<br>Remember that it is better if the teacher is a native speaker of the language.<br><br>•	The textbooks and teaching methods which are utilized.<br><br><br><br>•	The credibility of the courses. <br>Note that if the courses were established not so long time ago, it is more evidently that they didn’t establish solid reputation and wouldn’t be able to provide you with all the necessary facilities, professional teachers and guarantee you respectable certificate.<br><br>•	The recognition of the courses by the Council of the country the language of which you are studying.<br>This factor is highly important when choosing language courses. If the courses are recognized by the Council it acknowledges that the level of language teaching offered in these courses is adequate. Keep in mind that courses attached to the Council are always more respectable. First, the tutors there are native speakers. Second, the certificate of The Council is generally accepted.<br><br>•	The curriculum of the course. <br>Clarify at once whether the course you are going to take is a set of modules designed for students taking short-term courses or it is a full structured course. <br>Keep in mind that the way the language is taught is a very important point, because the methodic of teaching foreign language as a second language differs much from the methodic of teaching this language as a native one. <br><br>•	The variety of programs the courses can offer (business, conversational language, language for some specific fields, for Law, for medicine, intensive course).<br>The diversity of the languages and programs the courses can propose adds up to their credibility and reliability. <br><br>•	The longevity of holidays.  <br>For sure there must be a break in studying, but it mustn’t be too long for you not to forget everything you’ve learned. You must be in the language speaking environment as much as possible. Hence, the language must be on the credit side, you should use the language actively.<br><br>•	The courses fee.<br>Check all the money details very carefully. Check whether the registration fee is included in the general price for course. Get to know what a variation of fee for different programs is. Make sure if there any discounts for the program you are going to attend.<br><br>•	The organization of any extracurricular activities: social events, excursions, discussion halls.<br>Get to know if there is any extra charge for these.<br><br>Hope that these selection criteria of the foreign language courses will come in handy to you and will help you choose the courses where you master the language perfectly well. Test them in practice and make certain that they are sure fire to work.<br>
