				<span style="font-size: 11pt"><br>Math has been one of the most mystifying subjects for everyone. If you are a kid or an adult you will definitely have your own reasons to love or hate math. There are individuals who are naturally good at math, while there are also individuals who have problems getting along with math. But it is a fact that everyone needs help in math at some stage of his life, may be to score well in examinations or to understand the subject better. If we talk about help in math, you must take care of certain things that are mentioned below:<br>Understanding mathematical concepts. <br>First and foremost thing is to understand the concepts while doing math, be it algebra, geometry, or elementary mathematics. This will help you a great deal, for without understanding the concepts you may find problem-solving hard and tedious. <br>Remember, math is not about rote learning, but about understanding. <br>Learn formulas by heart<br>Learn only one thing by heart in mathematics: the formulas. Math formulas not only help you solve equations, but also save your time if you store them in your mind. Remember, if math is a lock, then formula is the key; the task is to put the key in the correct hole<br>Be regular with assignments and homework<br>Doing math homework reinforces the skills your have learnt in the classroom. Do as many assignments as possible. The adage ‘Practice makes the man perfect’ stands true in math. <br>Understanding word problems <br>Mathematicians have an expression: To learn to solve problems, you must solve problems. To help yourself solve word problems, try to read a word problem several times. Understand it clearly before solving it. Try to draw a picture or diagram so that you can get a picture. Reduce the equations by substitute smaller numbers for larger ones. <br>Learn the glossary <br>This is very important, especially for word problems. Learn the terms of mathematics. Terms like deficit, perpendicular, or ratio should be known to you. They will always help you to save time and increase your chances of solving the problems correctly. <br>All in all, self-help is the best help in math. For each branch of mathematics you have to learn new concepts and formulas, so always be ready for a new challenge. Keep practicing questions, from easy to tough ones, and do not get demoralised or frustrated – remember that you are a human after all.<br>
