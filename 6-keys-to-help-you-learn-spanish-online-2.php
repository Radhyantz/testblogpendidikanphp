				<span style="font-size: 11pt">Six Keys to Help You Learn Spanish Online<br><br>This article consists of six tips to help<br>you learn Spanish online. If you follow these<br>six tips, you can be sure that you will <br>learn to speak Spanish online much easier.  <br><br>Key Numero Uno to Learn Spanish Online:<br><br>"Stay motivated"<br><br>I think everyone that studies<br>a foreign language will experience<br>a time when they are becoming less and less<br>motivated. You may feel that you are <br>losing your desire to learn Spanish online <br>around the same time that you have reached a plateau.<br><br>If you feel that you are losing your desire<br>to learn to speak Spanish online,<br>try planning a trip to a Spanish speaking country.<br>Since you will want to get the most out of <br>your trip, this should motivate you to study.<br><br>Here's another tip to help you stay motivated and<br>to make you want to learn to speak Spanish online.<br>Find a native speaker that you are romantically interested<br>in. Since you will probably want to impress him or<br>her with your Spanish, this should motivate you<br>to keep studying and make you want to learn Spanish <br>online. You will also notice that you<br>are making progress quicker by practicing your<br>Spanish with a native speaker and that should also<br>motivate you to keep studying and practicing Spanish.<br><br>Of course, this tip only applies to single people<br>or other people without a significant other. <br><br><br>Key Numero Dos to Learn to speak Spanish Online:<br>"Don't Be Afraid of Making Mistakes"<br><br>Make lots of mistakes. And then after you have made<br>lots of mistakes go make some more mistakes. And then<br>go make some more mistakes. <br><br>Many people are afraid of making mistakes<br>when learning Spanish online. If you really<br>want to learn to speak Spanish online, then you<br>have to accept the fact that making<br>mistakes is part of the learning process.<br>The more mistakes you make, the quicker <br>you learn to speak Spanish online. <br><br>If you are not making mistakes, that's probably<br>an indication that you are not making<br>the effort to learn Spanish online. <br><br>Some people will try to learn to speak Spanish<br>online by ONLY listening. Their reasoning is <br>that once they learn enough Spanish that's <br>when they will begin trying to speak Spanish online. <br>But I can I assure you that it doesn't work that way. <br>It works in reverse.<br><br>That is, once you start trying to speak Spanish<br>and making mistakes that's when you will begin to <br>learn to speak Spanish online. Not the other way around. <br><br>So go ahead and make mistakes. The mistakes<br>aren't there to embarrass you. The mistakes<br>are there to help you master Spanish.<br><br>Key Numero Tres to Learn Spanish Online: <br><br>"Focus on how to speak Spanish" <br>Don't focus on "why Spanish is Spoken<br>the  way it is"<br><br>Many people have sent me emails with questions<br>such as why is it "me gusta" (I like) instead<br>of "me gusto" or why is it "me toma" instead<br>of "me tomo" <br><br>Of course, I  could easily answer these questions.<br>(And I do) But the objective is not to try equate everything<br>in Spanish with English or your native language.<br><br>Accept the fact that Spanish grammar is different<br>from  English grammar. And focus on the objective<br>of any language -- which is to communicate effectively.<br><br>And in order to communicate effectively, you only<br>need to understand and be understood. It is not <br>necessary that you understand each and every <br>grammatical facet. <br><br>Trying to do so will only hinder your learning and make<br>it difficult to learn Spanish online.<br>Imagine trying to teach a 4 yr old the definition<br>of a direct pronoun vs. an indirect pronoun.<br>We would never attempt such a thing. But the<br>4yr old child is still fluent in his or her<br>native language.<br><br>So make your goal to understand and be understood.<br>Focus on "how to speak Spanish" <br>Don't focus on "why Spanish is Spoken<br>the  way it is." <br><br><br>Key Numero Cuatro to Learn to Speak Spanish Online: <br><br><br>"Master the Fundamentals"<br><br>Many people spend their time learning<br>a bunch of Spanish vocabulary that they could<br>go a life time and never use. That's <br>because the words are hardly used<br>in normal everyday conversation. <br> <br>If you want to learn to speak Spanish online without<br>Wasting anytime, I advise you to master<br>the fundamentals.  When I say the<br>"fundamentals" I am referring to<br>the basic vocabulary and basic grammar. <br><br>I know adults that have studied Spanish<br>for a few years and they know thousands<br>of words in Spanish. Although they may<br>be proficient in Spanish, I would not <br>consider them fluent. On the other hand,<br>a three or four year old native Spanish-speaking<br>child can speak Spanish fluently. It is not <br>because the child knows thousand of words in Spanish.<br>The child may only know about a thousand words<br>or less in Spanish. But the child has mastered the fundamentals.<br><br>Mastery of the fundamentals is what separates<br>the proficient from the fluent. <br><br>If you really want to learn to speak Spanish online<br>make it a priority to master the fundamentals. <br><br><br>Key Numero Cinco to Learn Spanish Online:<br><br><br>"Take Advantage of downtime"<br> <br>Finding time to study can be a challenge.<br>Many people just don't have the time <br>to sit down and study. But who said that<br>you have to be sitting down? If you are<br>waiting in line at the bank or waiting at the <br>doctor's office, turn on your mp3 player<br>or ipod and listen to an audio Spanish lesson. <br><br>If you drive to work everyday, that's<br>an excellent opportunity to practice your  favorite<br>audio Spanish course. If you like to jog or <br>exercise on a stairmaster or treadmill, <br>bring your mp3 player or ipod with you<br>and listen to your favorite audio Spanish course<br><br>Instead of watching the 10' clock News. Watch<br>"Las Noticias" Instead of watching a movie<br>on HBO,  watch a movie on HBO Latino. <br><br>So to those that say "I just<br>don't have the time to learn Spanish online." <br>My response is that you can make excuses <br>or you can learn to speak Spanish online.<br>But you can't do both. The choice<br>is yours. <br>   <br>Key  Numero Seis to Learn to speak Spanish Online: <br><br>"Become an Imitator"<br><br>Some Spanish courses do not put much emphasis<br>on pronunciation. I think that is a big mistake. <br><br>If you really want to be understood, you must try <br>to mimic native speakers. <br><br>Have you every experienced someone that<br>asked you for directions or some other question<br>and you were unable to assist the person because you didn't<br>speak her language. And then you suddenly <br>realized that the person was actually speaking<br>English but her accent was so thick that you <br>thought the person was speaking another language. <br><br>The same thing happens to Spanish ears. If<br>you do not develop good pronunciation, you will<br>not be understand. <br><br><br>If you say the word "dad" in Spanish and you do<br>not stress the appropriate syllable, a <br>native Spanish speaker may think that you are<br>talking about "french fries." To English ears<br>the difference may be very subtle. But to the<br>Latin American its the difference between <br>"dad" and "potatoes". <br><br>So focus on mimicking native Spanish speakers.   <br><br>I hope that you enjoyed these 6 Tips to Help You <br>Learn Spanish Online and that they truly help<br>you in your journey to learn to speak Spanish online.  <br><br>Patrick  Jackson<br>
