				<span style="font-size: 11pt">The opportunities for continuing education are incredibly<br>diverse, thanks to the technology of distance learning and<br>elearning. Because of the sheer number of people who are<br>looking to improve themselves, it was inevitable that a<br>large number of colleges, universities and businesses set<br>out to fill that need. <br><br>The result is that people are learning new skills, honing<br>talents and reaching goals, all while going on with their<br>lives. For many people, furthering education and attending<br>classes are limited because they are already involved in<br>their adult lives. Jobs, family obligations and other<br>responsibilities limit the amount of time many people have<br>available to devote to their own education. <br><br>Distance learning allows thousands of people to achieve<br>degrees from programs hundreds of miles away. In this day<br>of convenient travel options, it might be tempting to say<br>that anyone can attend college or classes anywhere. Despite<br>our mobile economy, many people simply don't want to move<br>and don't have the time to travel great distances to attend<br>classes. That means that their opportunities are limited to<br>the programs that are offered nearby. Until distance<br>learning and elearning became so widely available. <br><br>Briefly, the difference between distance learning and<br>elearning is a matter of how the course is structured.<br>Distance learning requires that the student attend classes<br>at a prearranged time on a regular basis. An instructor who<br>is actually teaching in another facility (across the state<br>or across the nation) lectures makes assignments and<br>teaches just as normal. <br><br>The students in the satellite facility have the opportunity<br>to interact with the teacher through two-way<br>communications. The major advantage is that students are<br>attending class right in their own neighborhoods, at<br>community colleges, universities, schools and even public<br>facilities instead of traveling to the site where the<br>teacher is actually conducting class.<br><br>Compared to distance learning, elearning is even less<br>structured. Typically, students work at their own pace<br>through online courses. There may be pre-recorded lectures,<br>worksheets, assignments and tests, all viewed and completed<br>online. <br><br>The major advantage here is that students have an even more<br>flexible attendance policy and can choose to work through<br>the material as quickly or as slowly as they want, though<br>some courses do have time limits for completion. <br><br>When you add it all up, both distance learning and<br>elearning offer opportunities that simply wouldn't be<br>available any other way. People who would otherwise be<br>"stuck" with no way to further their educations now have an<br>option. <br>===========================================================<br>Find out why distance learning lets anyone go back to<br>school.

 About the author:<br>
 
  John Tipton dropped out of school early, and worked boring <br>jobs for 20 years. Then he discovered 'distance learning' <br>and finally got the education he missed. After lots of <br>different courses at lots of different schools, Peter <br>shares his experience in this series of useful articles. <br></font>
